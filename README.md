# Basketball Counter

## Overview

Live version [here](https://basketball-counter-frbl.netlify.app/)

I'm currently refreshing my entire JavaScript knowledge through a course on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/allcourses)
The assignment was to make a simple scoreboard for a basketball game

I wanted to take it a tiny bit further: 
* I added a clock, that counts down periods.
* Periods indicators are added
* Extra counters, for fouls
* Indicators of who is winning.
